This project aims to store all code produced for the Coding Dojo mettings at Saclay-Inria (http://www.inria.fr/centre/saclay).

To know more about coding dojo, go to http://codingdojo.org/

## Git Branches

* The 'master' branch contains this readme (by the moment...).

* The 'katas' branch surprisely contains the code produced in katas.

* The 'randori' branch surprisely contains the code solution for randoris.

Inside the 'katas' and 'randori' brances, the code is separated by folders indicating the language or utils used on the metting.
